Usability: Export to CSV file 

To implement export to CSV file functionality while maintaining the MVC architecture, UI design laws and OO design principles.
To achieve it, the following changes are needed:


Model:
- Model already keeps track of all the transactions along with filtered transactions and stores them. A method can be added which returns the transactions that are to be exported.

View:
- Add "Export to CSV" button in the UI.
- Add a JTextField so that the user can enter the output file name.
- Display error messages if there are any failures.
- Provide a tooltip: "Enter a valid file name ending with .csv".
- Add it to the button panel.

Controller:
- Handle the click event for export button.
- Validate file name.
- Call the CSV export method.

public void exportToCSV(String fileName) {
    if(!InputValidation.isValidFileName(fileName)) {
        view.showMessage("Invalid file name. Must end with .csv and not contain '@$#(){}[]/,.&*?<>'.");
        return;
    }
    List<Transaction> transactions = model.getTransactionsForExport();
    boolean exported = CSVExport.export(fileName, transactions);
    if(exported) {
        view.showMessage("Export to "+fileName+" successful!");
    } 
    else {
        view.showMessage("Export failed. Please try again.");
    }
}

For file name validation,

public static boolean isValidFileName(String fileName) {
    if(fileName == null || fileName.trim().isEmpty()) return false;
    if(!fileName.toLowerCase().endsWith(".csv")) return false;
    return !fileName.matches("@$#(){}[]/,.&*?<>");
}


- Add a new file for CSVExport which creates/opens the file with the given filename, adds the header row and then adds each transaction in a new row.
- Handle the exceptions while exporting.

The export method would be as follows:

public static boolean export(String fileName, List<Transaction> transactions) {
    try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(fileName)) {
        writer.append("Serial,Amount,Category,Date\n");
        int serialno = 1;
        for(Transaction t : transactions) {
            writer.append(serialno++ + ",").append(t.getAmount() + ",").append(t.getCategory() + ",").append(t.getTimestamp() + "\n");
        }
        return true;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return false;
    }
}


User Interaction Flow:
- When the user clicks on the export button, the expense tracker opens a text field which allows the user to enter the file name.
- Then the file name is validated.
- All the transactions that are being displayed are exported to the designated .csv file and a success/failure message is displayed.
